This is the github repository for the 3004B Project. For this project we created a proceduraly generated rythm game for mobile phones.

# About SoundWave Surfer
SoundWave Surfer is a rhythm game where the player takes the wheel of a sports car, and attempts to achieve the highest score on stages (aka beatmaps) generated via analysis of a music file. Currently only available on android phones/tablets. We used Unity to develop the game; so the apk can be built directly through the unity editor.
