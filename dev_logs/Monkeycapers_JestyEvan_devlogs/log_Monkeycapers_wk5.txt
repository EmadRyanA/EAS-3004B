Wrote the beatmap generating function. This function creates LaneObjects from beats and
adds them to a List in the BeatMap class. This class is saved as a .dat file.

Wrote a test JS website to visualize the beatmap and all laneobjects with the song
(protoTypePlayer.html)

For now, storing all song samples in the beatmap as a float[]. In the future the beatmap
should reference an audio file and load the samples from there.
