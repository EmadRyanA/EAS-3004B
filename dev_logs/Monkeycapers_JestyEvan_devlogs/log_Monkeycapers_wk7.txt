March 1st - 2nd

  - Worked on saving the result mp3 from the file picker & playing the beatmap using this mp3
  - instead of saving the large float[] in beatmap, save the location of the song (in persistentDataPath/Songs/)
  - and then load the mp3 file and populate samples
  - Save the songs metadata e.g title, artist, album
  - Save the coverArt to a png file in /Songs/
  - In the main menu, read all beatmap files and put into a listview with the Title/Artist and coverArt
  - (the list view is still WIP and needs work)
  - Integrated with howards changes to create a working prototype which was showed off in class

~12 hours
