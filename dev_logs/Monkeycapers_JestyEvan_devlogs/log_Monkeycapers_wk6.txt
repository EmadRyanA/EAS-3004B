Worked on supporting the native android file picker
  - Extended the main UnityPlayerActivity to override the onActivityResult function
  - this lets us capture the return of the file picker activity
  - to actually open the file picker we send an Intent
  - To call the java code special unity functions are used to call from c# and return to c# from java
