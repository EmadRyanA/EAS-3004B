Wednesday ~3hrs

Created basic beatmap structure.
The beatmap stores a list of LaneObjects (beats + obstacles).
The LaneObjects store an index (postion in the peaks[]) and an approximate time
Todo will support converting this list into a queue so LaneObjects can be popped.
More Todo The BeatMapPlayer will play the beatmap, using update() to check the current time in the song
and spawn LaneObjects
Worked on supporting saving beatmaps to files.
