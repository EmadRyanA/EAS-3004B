Thursday (~5hrs):
Worked on prototype beat detection.
So far, computes spectral flux for the sample data,
computes a threshold and uses it to isolate peaks.

Made a visualization for the output data in graphFlux.html.
This tool is to ensure that the peaks are accurate

More work todo:
"Clean up" The peaks array. 2 beats that are next to each other
need to be ignored.

Begin working on generating the beatmap. We cannot pick a beat from
each peak or it will be impossible, thus we need a way to filter peaks
further.
